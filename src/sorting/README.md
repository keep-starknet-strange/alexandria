# Sorting


## [Bubble Sort](./src/bubble_sort.cairo)

The bubble sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm used to sort a list of elements by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the list is sorted.  
The purpose of the bubble sort algorithm is to provide a basic and intuitive sorting method that is easy to understand and implement. While the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which can make it inefficient for large lists, it is useful for smaller lists and can serve as a starting point for more complex sorting algorithms. 

The time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2).  
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1).  
The bubble sort algorithm is considered one of the least efficient sorting algorithms, especially for larger lists, as its time complexity makes it impractical for large datasets. However, it is still useful in some specific situations where memory usage is a concern.


## [Merge Sort](./src/merge_sort.cairo)

The merge sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm used to sort a list of elements by dividing it into smaller sub-lists, sorting those sub-lists, and then merging them back together.  
The purpose of the merge sort algorithm is to provide a way to efficiently sort large amounts of data. The algorithm has applications in various areas of computer science and data analysis, including database management, information retrieval, and machine learning.  
Additionally, the merge sort algorithm is used in programming and software development, as it is a common example used to teach the concept of divide-and-conquer algorithms. By efficiently sorting large amounts of data, the merge sort algorithm provides a valuable tool for organizing and analyzing information.

The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n).  
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n).  
The merge sort algorithm is considered one of the most efficient sorting algorithms, as it has a good balance between time and space complexity, and can efficiently handle large amounts of data.
