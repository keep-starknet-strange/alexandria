# Data structures
## [Array extension](./src/array_ext.cairo)
A collection of handy functions to help with array manipulation. 

## [Merkle Tree](./src/merkle_tree.cairo)

The Merkle tree algorithm is a cryptographic hashing algorithm used to create a hash tree, which is a tree data structure where each leaf node represents a data block and each non-leaf node represents a hash of its child nodes.  
The purpose of the Merkle tree algorithm is to provide a way to verify the integrity and authenticity of large amounts of data without needing to store the entire data set. The algorithm has applications in various areas of computer science, including cryptocurrency, file sharing, and database management.  
The Merkle tree algorithm is also used in creating digital signatures and verifying the authenticity of transactions.  
By providing a secure and efficient way to verify data integrity, the Merkle tree algorithm is an important tool in cryptography and information security.

## [Queue](./src/queue.cairo)

The queue is used to store and manipulate a collection of elements where the elements are processed in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.  
The purpose of the queue algorithm is to provide a way to manage and process elements in a specific order, where the oldest element is processed first.  
The queue algorithm has applications in various areas of computer science, including operating systems, networking, and data processing. It is used to manage tasks that are processed in a specific order and ensure that the order is maintained.  
By providing a simple and efficient way to manage elements in a specific order, the queue algorithm is an important tool in computer science and software development.

## [Stack](./src/stack.cairo)

The stack is used to store and manipulate a collection of elements where the elements are processed in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.  
The purpose of the stack algorithm is to provide a way to manage and process elements in a specific order, where the most recently added element is processed first. 
The stack algorithm has applications in various areas of computer science, including programming languages, operating systems, and network protocols. It is used to manage tasks that require a temporary storage of data or information, and also for processing recursive function calls. 
By providing a simple and efficient way to manage elements in a specific order, the stack algorithm is an important tool in computer science and software development.
