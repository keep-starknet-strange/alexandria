# Linear Algebra

## [Norm](./src/norm.cairo)

Calculate the norm of an u128 array ([see also](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html)).

## [Dot product](./src/dot.cairo)

The dot product or scalar product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors), and returns a single number. Algebraically, the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers ([see also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)).

## [Kronecker product](./src/kron.cairo)

The Kronecker product is an an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers and returns an array of numbers([see also](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.kron.html)).
