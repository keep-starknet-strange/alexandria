## [Dot product](./src/dot.cairo)

The dot product or scalar product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors), and returns a single number. Algebraically, the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers ([see also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)).
